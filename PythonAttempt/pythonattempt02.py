    This code will be structured for the purpose of having a running
calculation of mass.  In order to properly propogate this,
a function which determines volume subtracted will be neccesary.

# First, a blank of appropriate size will be created from 'specs.txt'
Sdata = np.genfromtxt('specs.txt', usecols=0, delimiter=',', dtype=None)
# Sdata[0] = bearing type.  If it is '3', then it uses a C bearing
# Sdata[1] = Diameter, blank "height" will be gotten by halving this
# Sdata[2] = Width, blank "length" will be gotten by halving this
# Sdata[4] = Axle length, hole depth will be pulled from this
# Sdata[5] = unit system of axle hole, if 1 then metric and mm
# Sdata[6] = pilot hole diameter of hole.  Radius will be half of this

#Generating volume varitable from specs document
Blank_Radius = Sdata[1]/2
Blank_Length = Sdata[2]/2
Blank_Volume = ((Blank_Radius**2)*math.pi)*Blank_Length
# ALL VOLUMES WILL BE MEASURED IN CUBIC MILIMETERS
